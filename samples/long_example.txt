I have several issues today. My debit card keeps failing at four different ATMs with a 
'transaction declined' message, even though my balance is fine. The mobile app started crashing right after 
I upgraded from the Play Store, and push notifications have stopped, so approving 2FA is impossible.
I also want to begin closing my brokerage account and transfer my holdings to another provider this month. 
Before that, please explain the foreign transaction fees I saw in my June statement and if those can be waived, 
and how dividend withholding will be treated if I stay in DRIP a few more weeks. Finally, I changed my address 
last week and uploaded re-KYC documentsâ€”please confirm it has been applied to all my linked accounts.
